        For students in Computer Science Engineering, getting placed in campus recruitment processes is a vitally nerve bending phenomenon. This is generally because reputed companies with IT backgrounds and core companies are keen on recruiting people from placements. This lets the companies sit among a plethora of students and selecting people who would perfectly fit their organizations.<br><br>
        In any other form of recruitment, this element is certainly of low proportion. From the points of view of the students, campus recruitment can be that angel of opportunity knocking at the doors of their college campuses. To succeed in this race of campus placements, a student will need to be clear on what he/she needs to be clear with. That is, obviously, the subjects on which a student must be sincere and fundamentally knowledgeable. Apart from the soft skills that a person must develop in the course of education, knowledge over his/her subjects is undoubtedly the basic thing to clear the campus interview or any interview for that matter.<br><br>
        In this article, we have provided certain important subject topics on which the interviewers in campus recruitments dwell on questioning the students.<br><br>
        The placement session for any campus interview will have approximately three or four rounds.<br><br>
        The first round will be a written test. This written test generally consisted of common aptitude test questions. It contains four main subjects.<br><br>
        <ul>
        <li> <h4>Quantitative aptitude:</h4>
        This is more of a general question related to reasoning with mathematical techniques. To prepare for quantitative aptitude questions, one has to dwell on common aptitude examination questions, civil services questions, and other exclusive examination programs that facilitate quantitative aptitude.</li><br>
        <li> <h4>Logical Reasoning:</h4>
        Logical reasoning is also concerned with common aptitude questions. It consists of problems that are derived from a problematic situation that contradicts with general behavior. These problems need to be answered by reasoning with logical techniques. One of the most popular questions is asking a person’s age in relation to the ages of his/her friends or relatives.</li><br>
        <li> <h4>Verbal Reasoning:</h4>
        Verbal Reasoning consists of a set of questions that indulge in an attempt to test a student’s strength in English Grammar and ability. To prepare for verbal reasoning, one can just read more books to learn the structure of the language and/or practice questions with aptitude test papers.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h4> Computer Science Subjects:</h3>
        The above three subjects mentioned for the written test are common for all kinds of job interviews in campus recruitments. But to those interviewers who search for capable CSE engineering students, they have to question them in the sense of computer science. These questions on Computer Science subjects are asked in the written test rounds and also in technical and HR interview rounds, where one has to meet and answer personally to the interviewer. In these interrogations, the interviewer would be keen on testing the student on the fundamental understanding of concepts in computer science which also will have a direct linkage to the job profile.  The most important topics that are generally discussed in interviews are:<br><br>
        <ol>
          <li> <h4>OOPS:</h4>
          OOPS is Object Oriented Programming System. OOPS is a system by which programming is done with relation to certain objects classified in the system. It is constructed with the objective of integrating data and the functions that are understood as ‘this’ and ‘self’ in a way that only the pertaining function can access the concerning data.<br><br>
          OOPS in Java is one of the most sought after questions in interviews. Learning OOPS with strong foundations is one of the most important things that every student has to figure out.
          </li><br>
          <li> <h4>DBMS:</h4>
          DBMS or Database Management System is a system that stores and retrieves data as when in demand for the purpose of users and their clients with proper consideration of security measures. In other words, the DataBase Management System is a mode for managing data for customers. This is done with a certain set of programs.<br><br>
          Some of the common questions related to DBMS include SQL queries, Normalization, and transactions.
          </li><br>
          <li> <h4>OS:</h4>
          An Operating system (OS) is a central system that is applied to manage and control all other applications in a computer system. OS lends services to all applications that are communicated through the Application Program Interface (API). Other than communicating through applications, users can access information and give commands directly to the operating system through Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI).<br><br>
          The most considered questions in relation to OS are process, threads; Process scheduling, Deadlock, and virtualization, etc.
          </li><br>
          <li> <h4>Networks:</h4>
          A network is an inter-connective system by which two or more computer networks are connected for the purpose of receiving or transferring data from one or more computers to another computer(s). It also includes known devices used to connect network systems such as routers, hubs, switches, and bridges.<br><br>
          The common topics relating to Networking are IP addressing, UDP, LAN, WAN, MAN, and TCP, etc.
          </li><br>
          <li> <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms:</h4>
          Data structures and algorithms are common topics that cover the methods and techniques by which data is consumed or any other function is put together to cause the desired effect or command. Typically, a data structure is a location where data is stored and organized. The algorithm is a method or collection of steps to solve a problem.<br><br>
          A common question in relation to Data structures and Algorithms includes sorting and searching, binary search, recursion, stack and queue, linked lists and heap, etc.
          </li><br>
          <li> <h4>Programming languages:</h4>
          Obviously, programming languages is a fundamental subject to question any CSE student. The programming language is the communicative language by which any user can give commands to a computer system. 
          </li><br>
        </ol>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python, etc. come under important topics of questioning in the case of interviews. One or more of these popular programming languages must be learned by the student while the interviewer may question any language that is probably used in the organization.</li><br>
          <li> Apart from these subjects, some other topics like SQL, Deep Learning can also be brought under discussion. However, these topics are considered to be the most popular among many organizations and thus, the main ingredients to master for a student in order to crack the campus placements.</li>
